# Mountain Finder

This was a site that I made in eigth grade for the "20 time project". I didn't know (and definitely wasn't aware) of how to use an API. After going through my old repositories, I stumbled upon this project. I decided to update this project to really fit what this site was intended for

Mountain finder is a website designed to be a direcotry for mountains. You just have to search up a mountain, and the website will give you some information on that mountain. This site uses the SkiMap API to retrieve the information for mountains.

```
git clone https://github.com/JRProgramming/mountainfinder.git
